# 🗽 NYC Collision Analysis  

### 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions reported by the **New York City Police Department (NYPD)** from **January to August 2021**.  
Each record represents an individual collision, capturing details such as the **date, time, and location** (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), as well as **vehicles, victims,** and **contributing factors** involved.  

The goal of this analysis is to identify accident trends, high-risk periods, and major contributing causes — ultimately supporting **traffic management** and **public safety interventions** in New York City.

### 📈 Visualization Display  

#### 🧩Accident Trends & Frequency  
![](https://github.com/dunsinbridget-001/Nyc-Collisions-Analysis/blob/main/Accident%20Trends%20%26%20Frequency.png) 

> **Answers Question 1 & 2:**  
> - Compares total accident percentages by month to reveal **seasonal patterns**.  
> - Breaks down accident frequency by **day of week** and **time of day** to identify the most accident-prone periods.  

**Key Insights:**  
- June recorded the highest accident rate (**10.6K cases**).  
- **Midday hours (10:00–15:59)** showed peak collision occurrences, likely due to heavy traffic flow and driver fatigue.  
- **Friday** and **Sunday** recorded the highest daily accident frequencies.

> **Answers Question 3 & 4:**  
> - Identifies the **street with the highest number of accidents (Belt Parkway)** and calculates its percentage of total accidents.  
> - Highlights the most common **contributing factors** for all and fatal accidents.  

**Key Insights:**  
- **Belt Parkway** recorded the highest accident count (**1,229**), representing a large portion of total collisions.  
- **Driver inattention** was the leading cause of all accidents (~17K).  
- **Unsafe speed** was the main factor behind fatal accidents, showing behavioral rather than mechanical issues.

### 🧾 Analytical Report  

**Summary of Findings:**  
1. **Monthly Trend:** Accidents peaked in **June**, showing higher road activity during summer months.  
2. **Hourly Trend:** **Midday hours** recorded the most collisions, likely due to driver fatigue and heavy traffic.  
3. **High-Risk Locations:** **Belt Parkway** was identified as the top street for accidents.  
4. **Contributing Factors:** **Driver inattention** and **unsafe speed** were the dominant causes, both behavioral.

### ✅ Conclusion & Recommendations  

**Conclusion:**  
The analysis reveals clear behavioral and time-related patterns in NYC traffic accidents, particularly during **midday hours** and on **Belt Parkway**.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Increase **traffic enforcement** and **public awareness** during midday and summer months.  
- Prioritize **road safety campaigns** targeting **driver attention** and **speed management**.  
- Deploy **monitoring systems** and **safety signage** along high-risk routes to reduce collision frequency.
